                Every breath we surrender will turn back the death that continues to inflict on us ... Ultimately, this
                death is to be won, because it was part of our destiny since our birth and just shortly before devouring
                its prey, It plays with it. Nevertheless, we continue to live as much as possible with much interest and
                concern, as long as we may think longer in a soap bubble to become larger, albeit with full certainty.
                That will burst.

                with plastic balls, went shopping some day and went to the boy and told the boy to put on these shoe
                pants ... he was wearing a shoe box and happy He said to the old man: 'You are God?' The old man picked
                his lips and said no! The boy said, 'God's friend, because last night I just said to God that I had no
